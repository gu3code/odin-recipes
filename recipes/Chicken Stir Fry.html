    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Chicken Tikka Masala is a beloved Indian-inspired dish featuring tender pieces of marinated chicken cooked until juicy and charred, then simmered in a rich, creamy tomato-based sauce infused with fragrant spices like cumin, coriander, garam masala, and paprika. The sauce is smooth and velvety, often enriched with cream, giving it a luxurious texture and balanced flavor that’s both mildly spiced and comforting. It’s typically served with fragrant basmati rice or soft naan bread, making it a hearty and satisfying meal enjoyed worldwide.</p>

    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Beef Stir-Fry with Vegetables is a vibrant and flavorful dish that combines tender strips of beef quickly cooked over high heat with a colorful mix of fresh vegetables like bell peppers, broccoli, and snap peas. The beef is often marinated or tossed in a savory sauce made from soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and sometimes a touch of sweetness or heat. This fast and healthy dish delivers a perfect balance of textures — juicy meat, crisp veggies — and bold, umami-rich flavors, making it a satisfying meal that comes together in minutes. It’s typically served over steamed rice or noodles for a complete, wholesome dinner.</p>

        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp hoisin sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece fresh ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 cup snap peas or green beans</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil (for stir-frying)</li>

        <li>2 green onions, chopped (for garnish)</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Steps for cooking</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, toss the sliced beef with 1 tablespoon soy sauce and cornstarch (if using). Set aside for 10-15 minutes to marinate.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the beef and stir-fry until browned and just cooked through, about 2-3 minutes. Remove the beef from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining oil to the pan, then sauté minced garlic and grated ginger until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the broccoli florets, bell pepper slices, and snap peas, and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the pan and add the remaining soy sauce, oyster sauce, and hoisin sauce (if using). Stir everything together and cook for another 1-2 minutes to combine flavors.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and garnish with chopped green onions.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately over steamed rice or noodles.</li>
    </ol>

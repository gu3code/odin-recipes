    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a traditional Italian pasta dish known for its creamy, silky sauce made without any cream. It combines simple ingredients like eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, crispy pancetta or guanciale, and freshly ground black pepper to create a rich, flavorful coating for al dente spaghetti. The heat from the cooked pasta gently cooks the eggs, forming a luscious sauce that clings to every strand. This dish is celebrated for its comforting texture, smoky undertones, and elegant simplicity, making it a beloved staple in Italian cuisine.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>150g pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or Parmesan)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Salt, for pasta water</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps for cooking</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, heat a pan over medium heat and cook the diced pancetta or guanciale until crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water and then drain the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Quickly toss the hot pasta into the pan with the pancetta, then remove from heat and immediately add the egg and cheese mixture, stirring vigorously to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs.</li>
        <li>If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until you reach the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with extra grated cheese and black pepper on top.</li>
    </ol>
